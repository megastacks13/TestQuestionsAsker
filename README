WHEN DOWNLOADING YOU SHALL BE RECEIVING THE FOLLOWING FILES:
	run.txt
	TestQuestionGenerator.py
	README

In the run.txt you will find the command for executing the code, but it needs to be setted up.
	
	You may check the following:
		- The path for the code is correct. In the case the run.txt file is in the same folder as the code, it is, if not
		  it shall be changed to the correct one.
		
		- In case you want to have arguments:
			- Note that you may remove either the 3rd argument, the 2nd and the 3rd or all of them, not any step in between.
			- In the case you dont want to have arguments you will be promped with a question asking you the path for the 				  questions file. If not, you will have to set it in the file.

			- The 2nd argument is the number of questions you want to be asked, in the case you set a value greater than the
			  number of questions it will get the maximum possible. The default value is 10.

			- The 3rd argument is the title for the execution, in case nothing is set it will be set to "QUESTIONS".

Done this you shall rename the file for it to be: "set_the_name_you_want".bat
You may create several files, one for each file of questions.


To execute the code:
	You need to have installed Python 3.10 onward, download in: 
		https://www.python.org/downloads/

	The code was written in python 3.10. In the case any issues are encountered, return to this version. You may find it here:
		https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/

	Make sure you have the correct libraries by running in the cmd the following commands:	
		-> pip install colorama
		-> pip install random

	Done this, double click in the .bat file you want to execute and done.

When creating a questions file you should have in mind the following considerations:
    - Spacing is done on the printing
    - Each new line implies a new question
    - If the last element of the line is not an integer from 1 to n being n the number of questions an exception will arise.
    - Leave spaces between questions add "//;" in the line you want to skip WITHOUT SPACES.
    - To separate questions from answers use ";"
